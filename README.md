- Features: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100)

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling
- K-Means clustering and Elbow method for cluster selection
- Visualization and interpretation of segments
- Business personas and actionable recommendations

## Key Findings
- Identified X distinct customer segments:
    - **Segment 1 ("Budget Shoppers")**: Young, low income, careful spenders
